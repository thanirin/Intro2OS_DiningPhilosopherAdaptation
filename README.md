As you can see, we both help each other in order to finish the project. However, we wouldn't be able to finish the project without the help of..
- Aj Noraset who always gives us advice and help. 
- My friends, Kok, Arm, and Pok who have guided us and explained their project's logic, so we could debug our code.
- Geeksforgeeks for posting the algorithm and the code for dining philosopher problem.
- Other websites which help with C language, linux, and git.

Again, thank you everyone and everything for helping us completing this project.
